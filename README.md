# Regression-NFL-Project
Using multivariate regression analysis I will see if my program can correctly predict the winner and the over/under of games
This data is from profootballreference.com and uses total yardage, 1st downs, and the opponents defensive ranking in order to predict points scored in a game.
The data that the program uses to predict is the average yards and average 1st downs for the season.
This data is being used to predict games in week 13 of the NFL season. These are the results and predictions for the project.

1. Bills-Broncos - Prediction: Bills: 26 Broncos: 19 
2. Panthers-Packers - Prediction: Packers: 27 Panthers: 24
