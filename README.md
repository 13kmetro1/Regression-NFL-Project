# Regression-NFL-Project
Using multivariate regression analysis I will see if my program can correctly predict the winner and the over/under of games
This data is from profootballreference.com and uses total yardage, 1st downs, and the opponents defensive ranking in order to predict points scored in a game.
The data that the program uses to predict is the average yards and average 1st downs for the season.
This data is being used to predict games in week 15 of the NFL season. These are the results and predictions for the project.

1. Bills-Broncos - Prediction: Bills: 26 Broncos: 19 : Winner: Bills 48-19
2. Panthers-Packers - Prediction: Packers: 31 Panthers: 24 : Winner: Packers 24-16
3. Dolphins-Patriots - Prediction: Dolphins: 27 Patriots : 10 : Winner: Dolphins 22-12
4. Washington-Seattle - Prediction: Seattle: 26 Washington: 23 : Winner: Seahawks 20-15
5. 49ers-Dallas = Prediction: Dallas 23 49ers: 27 : Winner: Cowboys 41-33
6. Buccs-Falcons - Prediction: Tampa 28 falcons 19 : Winner: Tampa 31-27
7. Jaguars-ravens - Prediction: Ravens 33 Jaguars 13 : Winner: Ravens 40-14
8. Texans-Colts - Prediction: Colts 30 Texans 22 : Winner: Colts 27-20
9. Chicago-Vikings - Prediction: Vikings 23 bears 21 : Winner: Bears 33-27
10. Lions-Titans - Prediction: Lions 21 Titans 28 : Winner: Titans 25-46
11. Jets-Rams - Prediction: Jets 1 Rams 25 : Winner: Jets 23-20
12. Arizona-Eagles - Prediction: Cardinals 28 Eagles 21 : Winner: Cardinals 33-26
13. Saints-KC - Prediction: Saints 30 KC 31 : Winner: Cheifs 32-29
14. Giants-Browns - Prediction: Giants 25 Browns 27 :  Winner: Browns 20-6
15. Pitt-Cinncinatti - Prediction: Pitt 28 Bengals 14 : Winner: Bengals 27-17

Accuracy:11/16 = 68.7%

Thoughts: The model accuratly predicted the better team but failed to account for team's current state. If I were to attempt this project for another week I would factor in the current QB's passer rating as I believe that would have made a meaningful difference in some of the predictions bot with margins and with outcomes.
